# madewithlove.cfg

madewithlove is a W.I.P config that seeks to improve upon cluttery and unoptimized configs that have a lot of useless commands that do nothing for performance.
Our goal is to decrease the size of the config, getting max performance and being much more accessible to a wide range of machines that run Team Fortress 2.

Currently the config is being cleaned up and refurbished, we seek any feedback and benchmarks with our config for improving on it and seeing what's wrong and what's right.

Place the file into your Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg directory.
Make sure to rename it to autoexec.cfg if you would like to automatically load at game start up.
The optional.cfg is not required, if you choose to use it please uncomment out the "exec optimized.cfg" line in madewithlove.cfg
